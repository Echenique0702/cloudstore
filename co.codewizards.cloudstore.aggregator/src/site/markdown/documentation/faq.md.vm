Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
-------

$H$H$H Why is there no user name / password?

Because this is neither secure nor convenient. Users tend to use weak passwords, which renders the most secure
encryption algorithms useless. Additionally, handling passwords is cumbersome.

CloudStore uses a far more secure and much easier authentication scheme based on every repository having
its own public/private key pair. Before repositories synchronise data, they are introduced to each other,
establishing a trust relationship between them.

We will later add ordinary user+password-based authentication *additionally*, but this will never be used for
the actual synchronisation. It will only be used for other ways of accessing a repository (e.g. via a browser)
where this classic approach is needed. And since it\'s optional you might keep it disabled for security reasons.

Please consult the [Security](./security.html) page for further details.


$H$H$H Why are my system\'s certificate authorities (CAs) ignored?

Because the CA system is [broken](http://nwrickert.wordpress.com/2011/03/23/pki-is-broken/) by design: You do not
know any of the companies/persons acting as CAs and therefore you have no reason to trust them.

The NSA can easily make one of these CAs generate a certificate for *yourhost.yourdomain.tld*. If CloudStore
trusted the CAs blindly, you wouldn\'t notice that your client talks to a different server (in the middle)
instead of having a direct connection to *yourhost.yourdomain.tld*. This server in the middle could spy on you
or even modify all the data traversing it.

Therefore, CloudStore trusts only those certificates that you *personally* chose to trust. Trust cannot be blindly delegated.
